        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These deli-style potato latkes are crispy on the
            outside, creamy on the inside, and should always be
            served hot with plenty of sour cream and applesauce!

            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated onion</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                Slice peeled potatoes and run through a food processor fitted
                with the grater attachment. Place shredded potatoes in a
                cheesecloth and wring well to remove as much moisture as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Measure 2 cups shredded, drained potatoes and place into
                a medium bowl; save any extra for another use. Add egg,
                flour, onion, and salt, and stir until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high
                heat. Place large spoonfuls of potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing
                down on them to form 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick patties. Cook until golden
                brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side.
            </li>
            <li>Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain while you cook any remaining latkes. Serve hot.</li>
