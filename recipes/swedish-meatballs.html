        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Swedish meatballs are a classic comfort food featuring small,
            tender meatballs made from a mixture of ground beef and pork,
            seasoned with spices like allspice and nutmeg, and served in a rich,
            creamy gravy often accompanied by mashed potatoes and lingonberry jam.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream.
                Allow to stand until crumbs absorb cream, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir
                onion until light brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a mixing bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, allspice,
                and ginger with onion in the mixing bowl. Lightly mix in bread crumbs and cream.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Pinch off about 1 ½ tablespoons
                meat mixture per meatball; form into balls. Place meatballs into the skillet and cook,
                turning often, until browned, about 5 minutes. Insides of meatballs will still be pink.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place browned meatballs into a baking dish, pour in chicken broth, and cover with foil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are tender, about 40 minutes.
                Remove meatballs to a serving dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into drippings until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gradually whisk in enough beef broth to total about 2 ½ cups liquid.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring gravy to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Just before serving, whisk in sour cream.
                Season with salt and black pepper.
                Serve gravy with meatballs.
            </li>
